# dexa

dexa is a CLI tool that allows developers and teams to capture their preferred tech stacks as a project template with generators.

Each of these stacks is captured as a git repository. Create them in a publicly available service such as Github to encourage usage and sharing across the wider community. But you are also free to use dexa with private repositories.

> Requires **Node.js 14** or later!

## Introduction

### How can dexa help you?

Imagine you work in a team that frequently creates web applications with Vue3 and fastify. You probably have an opinionated way of setting these up, so you can capture your project template in a repo, allowing you to `dx init my-vue-fastify-template`.

You might sometimes use docker, you can then expand your repo with another template that adds docker and compose files so you can `dx add docker`. In some projects you might use postgre while in others you might use mongoDB, you can then capture 2 further templates that allow you to `dx add postgre` or `dx add mongo` to your project.

You will likely add several elements like pages or apis to your web application. Expand your stack with template generators so you can `dx generate page new-page` or `dx generate api new-api`!

In the end, you will end up defining your stack in a repo structured like:
```
/
|__ /init
|   |__ fileA
|   |__ /some/folder/fileB
|   |__ ...
|__ /add
|   |__ /docker
|   |   |__ ...
|   |__ /postgre
|   |   |__ ...
|   |__ /mongo
|       |__ ...
|__ /generate
|   |__ /api
|   |   |__ ...
|   |__ /page
|       |__ ...
|__ dexa.js // optional file, defines additional metadata/options/arguments for each template
```

Once the stack is defined in a repo:
- Install the stack by pointing to the repo, as in `dx stack add git@github.com:DaniJG/my-stack.git`
- Create a new project using the name of the stack, as in `dx init my-stack`
- Add stack features to a generated project by running `dx add` commands within the project root folder, as in `dx add docker`
- Generate code by running `dx generate` commands within the project root folder, as in `dx generate page my-new-page`

### Is it limited to JavaScript projects?

Absolutely not! While dexa is written in JavaScript, you can define stack templates for any language. In a nutshell, dexa will render the templates you define, what those templates contain is entirely up to you.

For example, you could create a terraform stack so you can `dx init terraform`. This stack could define features such as S3 or azure blob remote storage so you can `dx add remote-aws-s3` or `dx add remote-azure-blob`. In a similar fashion, you could then create generators for any common terraform modules you typically use, allowing you to `dx generate s3-bucket` or `dx generate aws-kubernetes`.


## Installation

You can install dexa as a global tool, making the `dx` executable available in your shell:
```sh
# install
npm install -g dexa
# verify
dx --version
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to run dexa commands without installing as a global tool:
```sh
npx dexa --version
```

## Roadmap

Init:
- DONE - create project from one of the current stacks init template
- DONE - add integration tests
- introduce project/stack classes
- create a dexarc file
- optionally create new git repo and first commit
- add custom pre/post actions in dexa.js. Call same signature than the .action (since its based on defined arguments/options)
- override default action (render template) in dexa.js. In addition to parameters of pre/post actions, inject a `dexa` object with methods to for example render a template
- add custom helpers for the templates

Stack:
- DONE add stack from git repo, using degit
- DONE move predefined stacks away from "stacks.json" (which should be gitignored and just created on save by stacks-manager)
- DONE add "init only" stack from git repo (ie, repo that doesnt have init/add/generate folders, the entire repo is just an init template)
- DONE remove stack
- Add tests for add/init/remove stack from git
- manage versions of stacks (update stack, keep track of version used with project)
- allow specifying a "path" inside the repo, to support repos defining multiple stacks

Add:
- allow stacks to define their "add" commands, by just adding a template folder inside `/add`. No need for any extra config or metadata in `dexa.js`
- allow extra config/metadata to be defined in dexa.js. A `defineCommand` method receives the commander program so users can add additional parameters/options. The same pre/post/action than in init are available
- allow users to optionally include available "add" commands when initializing a project
- allow command to depend on other add commands (fail if not added before)

Generate:
- allow stacks to define their "generate" commands, by just adding a template folder inside `/generate`. No need for any extra config or metadata in `dexa.js`, all commands will take a `[name]` required argument as in `dx generate page my-new-page`
- allow extra config/metadata to be defined in dexa.js. A `defineCommand` method receives the commander program so users can add additional parameters/options. The same pre/post/action than in init are available

Overrides:
- projects can override specific generators with a combination of dexarc and templates inside the .dexa folder
- projects can add their own additional generators in a similar fashion

Stacks:
- predefined "init" only stack to create your own stack
- vite + fastify stack
