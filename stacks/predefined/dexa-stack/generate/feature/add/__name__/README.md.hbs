The {{ userOptions.name }} feature.

This folder can contain:
- files with the `.hbs` extension, which will be rendered with handlebars, accepting the same parameters than the init command
- files with any other extension, which are copied as is

Any subfolders will be added to the project as if this README.md file was at the root of the project.

Usage:
```
dx add {{ userOptions.name }}
```
